# Are-Self UI — Tasks

Remaining work, sifted for the frontend. See FEATURES.md for what's built.

## Top Priority — PNS Expansion

- [ ] **Multiple Ollama endpoints UI.** Hypothalamus needs an affordance to add/edit AIModelProvider
  endpoints (host:port for secondary Ollama machines). Scanner UI similar to the executable scanner.
  **Paired with backend task.**
- [ ] **Live agent monitoring.** PNS should show active reasoning agents — which IdentityDiscs are
  currently in a session, what they're doing, session duration, turn count. Real-time via dendrite.

## Ship-Blocking

- [ ] **Session chat — messages not delivered or persisted.** Typing in the Thalamus chat window of a
  running Frontal Lobe session does not deliver the message (swarm_message_queue not receiving). On page
  refresh, the typed message is gone — not persisted as a ReasoningTurn. Two bugs: delivery + persistence.
  **Paired with backend task.**
- [ ] **Shutdown / restart controls — CSS and lifecycle.** Backend endpoints done
  (`/api/v2/system-control/`). SystemControlPanel exists on PNSPage. Restart works. **Remaining:** CSS
  layout fix (huge empty spaces), full app lifecycle (close browser windows, restart webserver). Consider
  moving controls to a global header/nav position instead of PNS-only.
- [ ] **Rename `SystemControlPanel` — off style guide.** "System Control" is mechanical/military-adjacent
  and violates the biological-naming rule. Candidates: `HomeostasisPanel`, `BrainstemPanel`,
  `MedullaPanel`, `AutonomicPanel`. Coordinated rename: component file, CSS class prefix, PNSPage import,
  any tests. Pair with the backend endpoint rename (`/api/v2/system-control/` → something biological) so
  the name maps cleanly front-to-back.
- [x] **~~Frontend <<h>> tag stripping in chat display.~~** `src/utils/humanTag.ts` with `HUMAN_TAG`
  constant and `stripHumanTag()`. Wired into `getRawText()` in both `SessionChat.tsx` and
  `ThalamusChat.tsx`. Strips a single leading `<<h>>` or `<<h>>\n`. Backend TODO to move the constant
  server-side still open (it lives in `river_of_six_addon.py`).

## Open Tasks

- [ ] **Neural Pathway Graph Editor — right-click context menu.** Demo feedback: "in Unreal you can
  right-click." Add right-click functionality with search of available items (neurons, effectors) for
  adding to the pathway. Backend already supports the item catalog — this is a frontend UX feature.
- [ ] **Neural Pathway Graph Editor — node inspector data reorganization.** The right-panel data when
  clicking a node isn't useful enough. Needs organizational rethink — what data matters at a glance vs
  what's detail.
- [ ] **CNS Neuron admin link.** Node click-through to Django admin shows black screen. The access DB
  record link is broken — verify the admin URL pattern for neurons.
- [ ] **Temporal Lobe — delete iteration verification.** Delete button with confirmation dialog added
  (TemporalMatrix.tsx). **Verify it works** — wired to `DELETE /api/v2/iterations/{id}/`.
- [ ] **Temporal Lobe — URL-driven iteration selection.** Currently selecting an iteration/definition is
  local state only. Needs URL params (`/temporal?iteration={id}` or `/temporal?definition={id}`) so
  refresh preserves context.
- [ ] **PNS worker preview — fill card area.** Worker preview cards on /pns should show more data.
  Implementation started — verify and expand.
- [ ] **PNS page layout.** SystemControlPanel at top of PNSPage creates large empty spaces. Needs CSS
  work to make it compact/inline with the beat bar or styled as a minimal header strip.
- [ ] **Navigation cleanup.** Hamburger menu has Hippocampus + Hypothalamus. Remaining brain regions TBD.
- [ ] **Identity ledger layout.** Remove always-open empty right panel when nothing selected.
- [x] **~~Identity — remove redundant Model Routing Configuration section.~~** Removed from
  `IdentitySheet.tsx`: the "Model Routing Configuration" sheet-section, the `SelectionFilterEditor`
  import, and the `showFilterEditor` state. `selectionFilters` state is kept — the Loadout dropdown
  above still uses it. Hypothalamus is now the single source of truth for routing config; the Loadout
  tab links through via the SelectionFilter and Budget fields.
- [ ] **EngramEditor — attach existing.** "Attach Existing" flow to link existing engrams to a disc.
- [ ] **Hypothalamus — family filter sort + zero-count hiding.** Family chips in filter panel need
  alphabetical sort. Consider hiding families with zero models (44 chips, 4 models on first load).
- [ ] **Hypothalamus — budgets tab editing.** Currently read-only. Need inline editing for budget periods,
  cost gates, spend limits.
- [ ] **Hypothalamus — vectorization after first sync.** After sync_local detects installed models, they
  need vectors for semantic routing. Could be a management command, a button, or auto-triggered after sync.
  `AIModel.update_vector()` exists. Requires nomic-embed-text in Ollama.
- [ ] **Environment filtering everywhere.** EnvironmentProvider and NavBar selector exist, but not all
  views filter by environment yet. Ensure temporal, PFC, frontal, identity views all pass environment to
  API calls.
- [ ] **Standardize API URLs to hyphens.** Frontend counterpart to the backend URL rename. Coordinated
  sweep — both repos change together.
- [ ] **Frontal Lobe session Parietal tab — drill-through broken.** Items in the Parietal tab and Parietal
  actions in the right window don't drill. Proposed fix: drill to zoom the matching 3D node so the full
  call is visible.

## Backlog

- [ ] **PNS historical view.** Currently live-only. Add past worker activity, task history from
  `django_celery_results` tables, completed task list with duration/status.
- [ ] **WebSocket coverage audit.** CNS dashboard may need live card updates when pathways run. Verify all
  views showing status use Dendrite, not polling.
- [ ] **Hypothalamus — standalone family/tag/category CRUD.** No dedicated CRUD for families, tags, or
  categories as standalone entities. Currently only manageable via description relationship pills.
- [ ] **Hypothalamus — subfamily routing UI.** Once backend supports prefer-subfamily routing, the routing
  inspector may need UI to configure subfamily preferences.

## Future

- [ ] **Image & audio manipulation UI.** Image preview in spike forensics when effector result is an image
  path, audio playback widget for WAV/MP3 results, modality indicator on Identity Loadout. Generation
  effector node component. Awaiting backend effector.
- [ ] **Brain mesh 3D background.** Replace abstract 3D background with actual brain region meshes using
  FBX assets. Regions: PreFrontal, Hippocampus, CNS, Parietal, Pons, Occipital, Hypothalamus, Peripheral,
  Reptilian — left and right hemispheres. Interactive on root route, static/subtle on inner routes.
- [ ] **Glassmorphic styling audit.** Consistent treatment across all views. Card styles, panel borders,
  hover states, selection highlights.
- [ ] **3D engram relationship graph.** Visual graph of engram relationships and provenance chains.
- [ ] **Identity — vector embedding visualization.** Sparkline or badge showing embedding status.
